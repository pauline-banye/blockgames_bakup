BLOCKGAMES INTERNSHIP TASK 3

Create a simple ERC20 and ERC721 tokens that make use of inheritance and imported libraries, using any framework of your choice(remix, hardhat or truffle).

Objectives:
Implement a standard ERC20 token with a fixed total supply of 1,000,000 tokens. Add a payable function "buyToken" which accepts an ethereum address, "receiver" as a parameter, and then increments the token balance of the receiver with bought tokens.  The cost of buying tokens would be 1000 Tokens per ETH. Increment the total supply with the newly created tokens
Create an ERC721 token. The token metadata should be stored onchain and the image in each metadata should be hosted on IPFS. Mint two NFTs with your contract

Json metadata files are in the ERC721/metadata folder
